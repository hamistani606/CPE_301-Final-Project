Evaporation Cooling System (Swamp Cooler)

Description: Designed and implemented an Arduino-based evaporation cooling system that monitors temperature, humidity, and water levels to control a fan motor and vent direction. The system transitions through different states such as IDLE, RUNNING, ERROR, and DISABLED, based on sensor input. Features include:

Real-time clock integration for tracking motor events and state transitions.
LCD display for system status updates and alerts.
Stepper motor control for vent angle adjustments based on user input.
Error detection and alert system when water levels are low, or temperature falls outside of defined thresholds.
Developed the system using Arduino libraries for motor control, LCD display, clock module, and sensor integration. Applied principles of embedded system design, including direct register manipulation for ADC sampling and interrupt-driven input for system control.
